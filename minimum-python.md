*assert* is used to check if the expression is correct or not. It returns **AssertionError** if the expression is false.

```>>> num = 4
>>> assert num == 4
>>> assert num == 5
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AssertionError
>>>
```

*pass* is used to fill in a statement and do nothing at all. 

```>>> class Empty_Class: pass
>>> object_ = Empty_Class()
>>> object_.value = 1
>>> object_.value
1
>>>
```
